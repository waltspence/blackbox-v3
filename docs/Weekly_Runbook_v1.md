# Weekly Runbook v1 — Roster/Manager/Fixture Hygiene

**When:** Thursday 18:00 ET

1) **Managers (MIL)**
   - Verify current managers for all top-5 leagues (and UCL last-16 teams).
   - Update style knobs: press_intensity, tempo, rotation_rate, subs_aggressiveness.

2) **Roster & Availability**
   - Cross-check injuries/suspensions; set `AvailabilityGuard` statuses.
   - Mark doubtful/out for key players that affect LIS.

3) **Fixture Context**
   - Mark congestion flags (three in eight days), travel, and must-win indicators for MS.
   - Tag deep-block opponents by profile list.

4) **Threshold Sanity**
   - Re-assert BCFI thresholds (0.58 away, 0.60 home; full fade 0.72).

5) **Dry Run**
   - Run SPX/Goalscape for all weekend matches; produce preliminary No-Anchor list.

6) **Change Log**
   - Commit `mil_updates_YYYY-MM-DD.yaml` + `bcfi_notes.md` to repo.
